# 🧾 Receiptly

**Receiptly** is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload images of their receipts or bills. It processes these images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract item-level details such as name, price, quantity, and category. The extracted data is stored in a database(MONGO DB) and presented in an interactive dashboard to help users track expenses , analyze spending patterns and plan budget for the month.
